# Treasury Hackathon – Solving Data Challenges for Central Decision Making  
  
## Why are we hacking?   
  
Recent years have demonstrated that the UK’s fiscal and economic context can shift rapidly in response to major events. In these times, the government relies on up-to-date analysis and forecasts of economic factors to create new policy and adapt fiscal plans. Our goal is to find novel ways of exploiting new data and technology to hack analysis solutions which can feed into central decision making at the Treasury in advance of the spring Spending Review.  
  
Treasury experts have highlighted a selection of high priority projects which provide options for investigating a variety of economic and data science challenges aimed at increasing the Treasury’s capability to respond quickly and with more insight to fiscal challenges.  
  
## What is the plan?  
  
- Two-day Hackathon in teams of 4 - 7 members.

- Hackers will pick their project at the beginning of day one and can organise themselves in groups within each project. 

- There will be technical and policy experts at the venues available for support and advice through the event.
  
- Can refer to the Hackathon website and Slack channel for any additional resources or questions.

- External experts at the venues will nominate the top teams to present their solutions.

- Top teams will present their solutions for panel judges who will decide on three finalist projects based on their innovation and potential impact.

## Projects:  
  
### [Nowcasting Consumption, Trade, and Business](consumption.md)   
  
Participants will find novel ways to update forecasts in UK consumption, investment, and trade through with the goals of increasing accuracy and capability of the forecasts.   
  
### [Developing our 'whole system' view of the criminal justice system](justice.md) 
  
Participants will explore new ways to harness, collate, model, and visualise data on demand in the criminal justice system.   
  
### [Nowcasting UK GDP](gdp.md)  
  
Participants to experiment with machine learning (ML) methods to create novel forecasts for UK GDP which they can compare these with traditional econometric models.   
  
### [Tracking and Visualising Global Trade Data with AI Tools](trade.md)  
  
When assessing international trade issues, the Treasury often needs to be able to track and visualise trade flows of goods and services, as well as trade barriers applied by different trading partners.  
  
### [Impact of inequality on Economic Growth](inequality.md)   
  
Participants will use public UK national and regional data over time to try and establish whether there is a relationship between income inequality and growth in the UK? And what can we say about the direction of causality?  

### [Housing now and near casts](housing.md)
  
Building 1.5m homes this parliament is one of the government top priorities. Having up to date estimates of progress against the housing target is vital when considering policy design. Official statistics measuring net additional dwellings are only released once a year and with a substantial lag whereas other potential indicators are available on a weekly basis. Your task is to build a model that predicts the outturn of the next statistics release for housing completions and housing starts. Feel free to bring any other public information into your model, and you should consider the structure of the housebuilding sector. 
Project extensions could involve extending the forecast up to a year into the future, prioritising accuracy of the now/near term forecasts. 
  
  
## What to Expect?  
  
This hackathon is designed to be a fun and inclusive experience. Here's what you can look forward to:  
  
* Collaborative Environment: Work in diverse teams to brainstorm and develop innovative solutions to real world problems.   
  
* Expert Guidance:  Technical Support and Treasury experts can help offer insight and guidance throughout the hackathon.  
  
* Hands-On Experience: Engage in hands-on activities and real-world problem-solving and design thinking.   
  
* Networking Opportunities:  This is a chance to meet new people, learn new skills, and have fun while working on meaningful projects.   
  
* Prizes and Recognition: Pitch your idea to the judges for a chance to win a prize and more important, gain recognition for your innovative solutions.
