## Housing now and near casts
  
Building 1.5m homes this parliament is one of the government top priorities. Having up to date estimates of progress against the housing target is vital when considering policy design. 
Official statistics measuring net additional dwellings are only released once a year and with a substantial lag whereas other potential indicators are available on a weekly basis. 
Your task is to build a model that predicts the outturn of the next statistics release for housing completions and housing starts. Feel free to bring any other public information 
into your model, and you should consider the structure of the housebuilding sector. 
Project extensions could involve extending the forecast up to a year into the future, prioritising accuracy of the now/near term forecasts.
